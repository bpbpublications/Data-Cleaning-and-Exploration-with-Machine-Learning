Project Code Bundles

This repository contains chapter-wise executable code snippets and supporting images that accompany the book. Each chapter folder corresponds to a section of the book and includes runnable programs and visual references that demonstrate the concepts presented.

Installation:

To install the required dependencies, run:

pip install -r requirements.txt


This will ensure all necessary Python libraries are available to execute the code snippets.

Contents:

code_bundles.zip
A compressed archive containing chapter-wise executable code snippets.

image_bundles.zip
A compressed archive containing chapter-wise images used in the book.

Chapter Folders
Each folder corresponds to a chapter in the book. Inside each folder, you’ll find:

Executable Python programs as presented in that chapter.

Relevant images (when applicable) for better understanding of the concepts.

Usage

Unzip both code_bundles.zip and image_bundles.zip.

Navigate to the desired chapter folder.

Run the Python script(s) inside the folder. For example:

cd Chapter4
python example_program.py


Open the corresponding images from image_bundles to follow along with the visual explanations in the book.

Notes:

Make sure you are using a compatible Python version (check the book’s prerequisites or requirements.txt for details).

If you encounter errors, verify that all dependencies were installed successfully.

Images are provided for reference only — code snippets will run independently but are best understood alongside the visuals.
